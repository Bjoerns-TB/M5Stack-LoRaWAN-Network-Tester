# M5Stack-LoRaWAN-Network-Tester

A LoRaWAN Network Tester based on the M5Stack, compatible with TTN (The Things Network)

## Setup
This is designed to work with the following hardware:
  - M5Core (Basic, Gray or Fire)
  - M5Go Base
  - M5Stack GPS Module
  - M5Stack LoRaWAN Module

#### Required Libraries!
  - [M5Stack]
  - [TinyGPSPlus]
  - [NeoPixelBus]
  - [M5_UI]
  - Seeeduino LoRaWan (Already included, patched and bugfixed)

 
#### Installation and Configuration
Upload this sketch to your M5 using the Arduino IDE. M5Stack Fire users have to disable PSRAM, because it will interfer with UART2.
UART2 with GPIO 16 and 17 willbe used for the GPS module and UART1 with GPIO 2 and 5 for the LoRaWAN module. Last can be changed in LoRaWan.cpp The UART Port on the LoRaWAN module has to changed (solderpads) to use this ports.

Replace the original files LoraWan.h and LoRaWan.cpp delivered by the M5Stack Library under M5Stack/src with the ones in the src directory.

## Instructions for Use

#### Menu

On boot you will be presented with the "Boot-Logo" followed by the first working mode. At the moment the tester has 6 modes to select:
  - [NACK](#nack) 
  - [ACK](#ack)  
  - [MAN](#man)  
  - [LCM](#lcm)
  - [SSV](#ssv)
  - [SET](#set)
 
You can move between menu items by pushing the button A.

#### NACK 
#### (No Acknowladge)
"NACK" is a mode that utlises the current device [settings](#set) to perform periodic transmissions. "NACK" mode is great for use with TTN Mapper.

Pushing button B will let you cycle through each spreadfactor. By pushig button C the display and LEDs will be turned off. Pushing button C again will turn them on.

#### ACK 
#### (Acknowladge)
"ACK" will perform the same test as NACK but it will request an ACK for every transmission. The RSSI and SNR values of the received packet will be shown on the display Pushing button B will let you cycle through each spreadfactor. By pushig button C the display and LEDs will be turned off. Pushing button C again will turn them on.

#### MAN 
#### (Manual)
"MAN" will send a LoRaWAN packet with ACK by pushing button C. Pushing button B will let you cycle through each spreadfactor.

#### LCM 
#### (LinkCheckMode)
"LCM" is a mode that will trigger a LinkCheckRequest. The TTN backend will report back the number of gateways which received the request. Pushing button B will let you cycle through each spreadfactor. The request is triggered by button C.

#### SSV 
#### (SiteSurvey)
"SSV" is supposed as mode for testing a location. During SSV mode the DutyCycle check will be disabled an the Node will send a LinkCheckRequest for every spreadfactor from SF7 to SF12. After the test the node will show you on which datarates a ACK was received back. The data is also stored on the SD card in GeoJSON format an could be analyzed with [geojson.io]

#### SET 
#### (Settings)

"SET" allows to change the transmission intervall in NACH or ACK mode. Possible settings are 15/30/45/60/120 seconds. Pressing button C will active the powersaving mode. The node will go to light sleep and wakes up every 15 seconds. Sleep mode can only be stopped by resetting the devicde (ToDo).

## Notes
  - The DutyCycle check ist activated except for the SSV mode.
  - If you have a valid GPS fix the GPS track will be written to the SD card as a GPX file.

## ToDo
  - ~~improve botton reaction~~
  - ~~cleanup the code~~
  - improve powersave features
  - Add OTAA 
  - inform about DutyCycle restriction on display
